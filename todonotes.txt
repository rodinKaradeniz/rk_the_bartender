TODOs:
- Test modules: implement unit tests and learn how to trigger them with github actions
- Add string_similarity.levenshtein_distance functionality to make_lemonade
- Build a simple UI/frontend
- Find a way to make ratings for the cocktails, maybe a survey? Or a prepopulated database?

NOTES:
- string_similarity line 4, can improve preprocessing
- csv_utils.load_ingredients_to_cocktails - think about improving efficiency
