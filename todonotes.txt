TODOs:
- Convert key_config into JSON and use it in both front and backend.

- Backend:
    - Test modules: implement unit tests and learn how to trigger them with github actions
    - Add string_similarity.levenshtein_distance functionality to make_lemonade
    - Build a simple UI/frontend
    - Find a way to make ratings for the cocktails, maybe a survey? Or a prepopulated database?

- Frontend:
    - Find an icon for the header
    - Find an icon/picture for the navbar
    - Implement and style json.result at index.html

NOTES:
- string_similarity line 4, can improve preprocessing
- csv_utils.load_ingredients_to_cocktails - think about improving efficiency

DONE:
