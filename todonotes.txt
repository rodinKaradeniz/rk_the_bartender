TODOs:
- Backend:
    - Suggestions: Each recipe response will have three content-based suggestions (probably using cosine similarity)
    - Translate: translate the recipe into any given target language.
    - Authentication: See if you can implement third party authentication servers, like google, etc.
    - Test modules: implement unit tests and learn how to trigger them with github actions
    - Add string_similarity.levenshtein_distance functionality to make_lemonade
    - Find a way to make ratings for the cocktails, maybe a survey? Or a prepopulated database?

- Frontend:
    - Find an icon for the header
    - Find an icon/picture for the navbar
    - Implement and style json.result at index.html

NOTES:
- string_similarity line 4, can improve preprocessing
- csv_utils.load_ingredients_to_cocktails - think about improving efficiency

DONE:
